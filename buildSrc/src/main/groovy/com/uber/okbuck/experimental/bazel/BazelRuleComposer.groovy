 * This class contains Bazel-specific overrides of
 * {@link com.uber.okbuck.composer.BuckRuleComposer}. It is a mixin trait as opposed to a subclass
 * because there are existing subclasses of {@code BuckRuleComposer} that are extended by their
 * Bazel counterparts, e.g.
 * {@link com.uber.okbuck.composer.JavaBuckRuleComposer} and
 * {@link com.uber.okbuck.experimental.bazel.BazelJavaLibraryRuleComposer}.
 *
 * Any Bazel rule composer class that needs these overrides should implement this trait.
